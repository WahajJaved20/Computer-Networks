# Problem Statement
Develop the reliable data transfer protocol (rdt 3.0). For the sake of simplicity consider only uni-
directional data transfer, but the control information will flow on both directions. You may use
the finite state machine (FSM) of the rdt 3.0 to understand all the states, events and actions.
Note:
You need to implement stop and wait protocol where only a single packet is in-flight. Further the
size and count of packets to be transferred should be configurable. You can also assume a fix
timeout period.
